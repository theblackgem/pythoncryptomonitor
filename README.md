# pythoncryptomonitor
Just a simple python thing to keep track of BTC prices and sends them to a discord webhook.

Libs you need:
1: pip install requests
2: pip install bs4
3: pip install discord_webhook

If theres anything I missed, just make sure to download the module it says that's missing

You can either CD into it and run it, or just open the py you downloaded.
