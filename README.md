# pythoncryptomonitor
Just a simple python thing to keep track of BTC prices and sends them to a discord webhook.

Libs you need:
pip install requests
pip install bs4
pip install discord_webhook

If theres anything I missed, just make sure to download the module it says that's missing

How To Run:
1: Put this into a folder/in a directory
2: Open CMD
3: type "cd (directory), ex: cd Desktop
4: Once in the directory type "py crypto" or "python3 crypto" depending on what works/what you have
5: Enter your webhook into the input

And that should be it.
